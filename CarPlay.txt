# Support for instrument cluster displays
Starting with iOS 15.4, you can add support for instrument cluster displays in supported vehicles.
Display your map and upcoming maneuvers, so they are visible at a glance in the carâ€™s instrument cluster display.

**CPTemplateApplicationDashboardScene** and **CPTemplateApplicationInstrumentClusterScene**
are new UIScene subclasses that CarPlay creates when it determines that your app should appear in CarPlay Dashboard or the instrument cluster.


Making a change here, don't mind me.
